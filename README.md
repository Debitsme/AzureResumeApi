# Cloud Resume API with Azure
This project demonstrates a serverless Cloud Resume API built using Azure Functions and Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL storage.
## Tech Stack

Azure Functions: Serverless compute platform for building and running code without managing servers.
Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL: Highly scalable NoSQL database service for storing your resume data.
Feature Added

Whenever someone visits my API, the view count increases. This allows us to track the reach of our Resume API.
